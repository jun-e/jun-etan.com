In the last 2 years I wrote ... articles for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com), averaging roughly one piece every ... weeks. This fact fills me with pride. I wrote this blog post to encourage everyone else to do the same, since it really pays off!

How do writers benefit from publishing their articles on Smashing Magazine, you may wonder? There are many many compelling advantages, but the main ones, at least for me, are the following ones.

## Getting publicity

If you are like me, most likely than not, you have something that could benefit from being publicized within the Smashing community. For instance, if you are a freelance designer or developer, showing your work and line of thinking will help you get new clients. If your agency builds websites, demonstrating that fancy-looking layout that you designed will portray your agency as being stylish and playful, or explaining how to write coherent copytext will establish your agency as a reliable provider of corporate solutions. If you sell services that tackle a need by the community, and you teach the ingredients that make your services work, you may get new customers. If you have an open source project, and you elucidate how it deals with a specific problem that someone in the community is experiencing, you may get contributors for your project. And so on and on.

Now, you can make the whatever-it-is-you-want-to-publicize the topic of your article, but you don't need to: Just by having your name out there you are already getting publicity. If your article is compelling, people will want to find out more about you, who you are and what you do. As an example concerning me, when typing "Leonardo Losoviz" in the input in Google, it suggests to autocomplete it as "leonardo losoviz pop", evidencing how people are looking for my project associated to my name. 

## Getting traffic

In some situations, publishing an article on Smashing (or, to be fair, on other popular tech websites too) is not just a nice-to-have, but it could be the deciding factor to attain your goal. This may be the case, for instance, for getting contributors for your open source project. In their guide [How to Spread The Word About Your Code](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/how-to-spread-the-word-about-your-code/), Peter Cooper and Robert Nyman recommend:

> A single tweet from @smashingmag could drive thousands of visitors your way, so consider tweeting them, and other similar accounts, when you have something relevant.

Now, think about it: If a single tweet from Smashing's account on Twitter can drive thousands of visitors your way, how much better can it be publishing the article on Smashing Magazine in first place? The tweet you got it for sure, and more too!

## Getting prestige

Publishing on Smashing also gives you plenty of face, which increases your chances of getting a job or being accepted to speak in tech conferences. 

## Getting paid

Smashing Magazine pays a fair amount of money for each article. Indeed, from the several websites I have experience writing for, Smashing Magazine has so far been the most generous one. 

However, you should think twice before writing an article if you do it just for the money, because it may not make sense. Taking into account the time required by all activities involved when writing an article (jotting down ideas, submitting a proposal, writing the article, sending it for review, editing it to incorporate feedback, replying to comments, and others), depending on your particular case, the amount of money that you will get may not justify the expense of time. For instance, if the article requires a full 7 days of work, and if you're working as a frontend engineer in some trendy US-based social network for which you get paid handsomely, then the money you will make from the article will not justify the amount of time put into it.

## Feeling good

Most likely, after writing a post on Facebook, sending a tweet on Twitter or uploading a pic of your lunch on Instagram, you have experienced that pleasurable sensation that surges through your body as feedback from your friends and acquaintances pour in. We are social animals, and sharing content with each other, either face-to-face or through online sites and social networks, is part of who we are. Publishing an article on Smashing is no different: after seeing that my article is online, my mood instantly goes up and a smile crops along my face. It just feels good.

The sensation is more pronounced when your content is truly appreciated by the target community (which, in the case of Smashing, mostly comprises web designers and developers) and you are sincerely thanked for it. For instance, an article of mine received the comment below, making my day:
