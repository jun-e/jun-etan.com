Friday.

In order to celebrate Labour Day today I did not work at all. Instead we had Labour Day pancakes, twice, and I pretty much spent the entire day napping, reading, and entertaining the idea of a new interest - birdwatching. 

Multiple inspirations led to this. First is of course *The Genius of Birds* that I'm reading, which has gotten me interested in the goings on of our local birds, since the ones described in the book are so endearingly intelligent. Second was an article that I was reading on The Guardian which encouraged people to look up (at birds) or look down (at insects) for nature photography. I'm not into photography but I do like the idea of using what's at hand to access what is out of reach. Plus, we live right next to a big patch of green and we've always had an abundance of bird life flying or twittering around. Third, but maybe to a lesser degree, is the idea of painting birds in Chinese ink, which was what I was trying to do before I got distracted by the whole lockdown business. 

So this morning I poked around the internets to find out what I could find for a birding beginner in Malaysia. Plenty, it appears.
