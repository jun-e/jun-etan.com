Wednesday.

We are at Phase 2 of the MCO today. We're not supposed to move outside a 10km radius of our home now. The government cautiously signals that we are doing better than projected - the curve seems to be flattening. As the lockdown continues, this blog continues. 

Not that I have that much to blog about. I spent most of today working, and worrying about work. Life of a freelance researcher is as such. 

The seeds have not sprouted, and I have not ventured out to the guard house to check if my ragi has arrived. Today we got some handmade masks from our lovely neighbour. 

I'm so tired. Tomorrow work lessens so I'll have time to chill a bit. And maybe do a proper post.
