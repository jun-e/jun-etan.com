Friday.

It is Day 10. Here are the headlines that caught my eye:

- Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, [tested positive for Covid-19](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus). Just a day ago Prince Charles has tested positive as well. 
- The Malaysian PM announced an [RM250bil stimulus package](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/27/muhyiddin-unveils-rm250bil-economic-stimulus-package) to cushion the blow of Covid-19 on the economy. At first skim it looks like it is quite focused on the people. I wonder how the direct cash transfers will be administered. 
- Malaysia has [2.5 months of rice stocks, after Vietnam closed rice exports](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/27/malaysia-has-rice-stocks-for-25-months-as-vietnam-curbs-exports). Vietnam is the world's third largest exporter of rice, so we're probably going to see a global shortage. It would be good if we start rationing rice purchases so that assholes don't panic buy again.
- [US now has more cases than China.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump) 
- [Scientists have found a plastic-eating bacterium](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/scientists-find-bug-that-feasts-on-toxic-plastic). It is still far, far away from being a feasible solution for our problems though. They say 10 years. 

In other news, Lazada had some sort of sale today and I bought a vacuum cleaner, a Wifi repeater, and five reams of A4 paper. Would have wanted Post-it's as well but it seemed expensive without free shipping. I miss our neighbourhood stationery shop. I also miss chicken rice.

This morning as part of my little act for the garden, I applied compost to a few pots: the rose that is a bit overwhelmed by the spider plant, the passionfruit plant, the henna tree, and the kaffir lime leaf plant. I think this weekend I will put in a bit more work, and if I am able to clean things up sufficiently, I will start planting vegetables from the seeds that I bought years ago. Let's see if they work and we can start a little vegetable farm in our balcony. It'd be nice to be able to harvest leafy vegetables as we grow them - and some take just a month. Probably we'll still be stuck in our houses by then.

Someone said today: "I smell like a farting rose. A farting rose, still a rose is".

The urge to make something that's not work has been strong... even though right now while I'm writing this I'm not working, the daily deadline of posting something *feels* like work. Today I considered drawing something as part of this blog, but the energy level never got to the point of enabling that. Maybe next week I might try out the format of a visual diary. Let's see. 

Or maybe designing a garden may be the perfect outlet for my creation anxiety. Hohoho. Let's see.
