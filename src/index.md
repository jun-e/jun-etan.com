This is the personal website of **Jun-E Tan**. 

I'm an independent researcher who also has many interests on the side. This will be where I document my explorations both professional and incidental. 

This will always be a work in progress, but at the moment, even more so. Please bear with me as I set up the pages. (September 2019)
