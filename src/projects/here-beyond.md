### About the project
- Title: Here Beyond (Art Exhibition of Komeil Zarin)
- Collaboration with: [Komeil Zarin](https://www.instagram.com/komeil.zarin/)
- Date: March 2019
- Nature of project: I produced a writeup for Here Beyond, describing the collection, the process, and the motifs of Komeil's art exhibition. The exhibition was held in March 2019, hosted in Improv Bistro, Kuala Lumpur. The writeup was also included in the exhibition catalogue. This is the first artistic collaboration that I have done and I found the experience to be very gratifying.
