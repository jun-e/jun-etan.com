Researcher based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Lifelong learner, flailing multitasker, recovering procrastinator. 

Do feel free to browse the sections of my website while I try to figure out what to write here. 

I also have an Instagram profile where I post the art that I make, whether it is sketches, paintings, or Lego installations - follow me [@juneysketches](https://instagram.com/juneysketches).
