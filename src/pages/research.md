For most of my professional life I've been engaged in research, specifically research that often have policy or advocacy implications. 

Just jump to the section that you are interested in:

- [A list of my publications](#heading-my-publications), some with links to download
- Some [research ideas that I've proposed](#heading-research-ideas) or played with, but have not been able to execute (yet!)

### My Research Interests
I'm a bit of an academic mutt, as I have a PhD in Communication (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), a Master's degree in Public Policy (University of Malaya, Malaysia), and a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems Engineering (UTAR, Malaysia).

This is an image that I made in 2018 to explain to my students the network of my research interests. For the time being I guess the three main themes are sustainable development, human rights, and digital communication. Some elaborations to give more context:
- 2008 - 2012 - When I was doing my PhD in Nanyang Technological University (in Communication), I was studying how people build trust on platforms such as Couchsurfing.com, where you first have to make an impression online, then move the connection offline. The thesis covered subcultural capital and "performing cosmopolitanism" in the subculture of Couchsurfing, and also included a chapter on the history of Couchsurfing up till 2012. 
- 2013 - 2015 - I came back to Malaysia and worked in a think tank, the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia, in the department specialising in environmental policy and sustainable development. My focus at that point was social and solidarity economy (SSE), looking at case studies on alternative economies that respect people and the planet. During this time I wrote a paper on SSE and sustainable development in Malaysia. On the side I was also running [MESYM.com](https://www.mesym.com), an environmental platform based in Malaysia, with its associated MESYM Documentary Nights. 
- 2015 - 2017 - From mid-2015 to early 2017 I was an independent researcher. Within this period some of the projects that I did were a research paper for the Japanese Institute of International Affairs (JIIA) on social protection for the informal economy in Malaysia, and a report on Freedom of Association and Assembly Online in Malaysia, commissioned by APC-IMPACT. On the side I was interested in issues of free trade agreements (TPP mainly), and jumpstarted a platform for generating discussions on the topic, [TPPDebate.org](https://tppdebate.org); I also represented the Asian Solidarity Economy Council in various forums on my interests of social and solidarity economy.  
- 2017 - I worked for a year with a regional human rights NGO Innovation for Change - East Asia as their communication and information officer. In this year I did not do research, but gained experience in other areas such as building and implementing a communication strategy, project management, and coordination. One of the projects that I coordinated, which would be useful for the next year, was a series of digital security trainings for four Southeast Asian countries (Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia) for human rights defenders and high risk populations. I also gained a lot of regional civil society friends, which was really nice :)  
- 2018 - In 2018 I went back into being independent - aside from small projects here and there on civic tech and environmental policy, one of the main things I did in 2018 was to lecture part time in Monash University on the course of *Global Digital Media: International and Transnational Communication* in their Master's course. I liked teaching but part time lecturing work is actually rather precarious (low pay work and benefits that do not reflect the amount of work) and I didn't want to do it for the long term. So I decided not to.
- 2019 - In 2019 I started to work on digital rights in earnest, while doing some other small projects to pay the bills. I conducted a research project under SHAPE-SEA, studying the digital rights movement in Southeast Asia. I built a conceptual framework of what digital rights is, and looked at the challenges faced by the movement, plus recommendations from digital rights activists on how to improve the movement.

### Research Ideas
Part of my work as a researcher is to write research proposals when I'm bidding for projects or research work. These proposals often take a long time to craft and to tailor to the application. Due to the breadth of my research interests I'm also often making proposals that are outside of my comfort zone, adding to the time spent on each proposal. Instead of letting the rejected proposals languish in some corner of my hard disk, I'm celebrating them and posting some of them up here for interested folks to take a look. I've not updated any of them, so here they are frozen in their time and context (without the name of the institution that I was originally applying for - and I also added my contact details to each file): 
- 2019 
	- The Big Picture for Digital Rights Framework: Bridging academic research and grassroots activism in Southeast Asia ([full proposal](/documents/research-ideas/2019-bpdrframework.pdf))
	- Rights for all, except rights workers? Working conditions within advocacy NGOs in Southeast Asia ([full proposal](/documents/research-ideas/2019-rightsforallexceptrightsworkers.pdf))
- 2018
	- Business-as-usual or Building Back Better? Post-disaster recovery of local economies in Japan and Malaysia ([full proposal](/documents/research-ideas/2018-postdisasterrecoveryoflocaleconomies.pdf))
- 2017 
	- Civil society participation in the implementation of SDGs in Asia: A comparison of policy networks in Japan, Malaysia, and Timor Leste ([full proposal](/documents/research-ideas/2017-civilsocietyparticipationinsdgs.pdf))
