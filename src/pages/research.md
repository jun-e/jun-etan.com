### My Research Interests
![](/images/research-interests.png)
This is an image that I made in 2018 to explain to my students the network of my research interests. For the time being I guess the three main themes are sustainable development, human rights, and digital communication. Some elaborations to give more context:
- 2008 - 2012 - When I was doing my PhD in Nanyang Technological University (in Communication), I was studying how people build trust on platforms such as Couchsurfing.com, where you first have to make an impression online, then move the connection offline. The thesis covered subcultural capital and "performing cosmopolitanism" in the subculture of Couchsurfing, and also included a chapter on the history of Couchsurfing up till 2012. 
- 2013 - 2015 - I came back to Malaysia and worked in a think tank, the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia, in the department specialising in environmental policy and sustainable development. My focus at that point was social and solidarity economy (SSE), looking at case studies on alternative economies that respect people and the planet. During this time I wrote a paper on SSE and sustainable development in Malaysia. On the side I was also running [MESYM.com](https://www.mesym.com), an environmental platform based in Malaysia, with its associated MESYM Documentary Nights. 
- 2015 - 2017 - From mid-2015 to early 2017 I was an independent researcher. Within this period some of the projects that I did was a research paper for the Japanese Institute of International Affairs (JIIA) on social protection for the informal economy in Malaysia, and a report on Freedom of Association and Assembly Online in Malaysia, commissioned by APC-IMPACT. On the side I was interested in issues of free trade agreements (TPP mainly), and jumpstarted a platform for generating discussions on the topic, [TPPDebate.org](https://tppdebate.org); I also represented the Asian Solidarity Economy Council in various forums on my interests of social and solidarity economy.  
- 2017 - I worked for a year with a regional human rights NGO Innovation for Change - East Asia as their communication and information officer. In this year I did not do research, but gained experience in other areas such as building and implementing a communication strategy, project management, and coordination. One of the projects that I coordinated, which would be useful for the next year, was a series of digital security trainings for four Southeast Asian countries (Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia) for human rights defenders and high risk populations. I also gained a lot of regional civil society friends, which was really nice :)  
- 2018 - In 2018 I went back into being independent - aside from small projects here and there on civic tech and environmental policy, one of the main things I did in 2018 was to lecture part time in Monash University on the course of *Global Digital Media: International and Transnational Communication* in their Master's course. I liked teaching but part time lecturing work is actually rather precarious (low pay and benefits for a lot of work) and I didn't want to do it for the long term. So I decided not to.
- 2019 - In 2019 I started a research project under SHAPE-SEA, studying the digital rights movement in Southeast Asia. I built a conceptual framework of what digital rights is, and looked at the challenges faced by the movement, plus recommendations from digital rights activists on how to improve the movement.
